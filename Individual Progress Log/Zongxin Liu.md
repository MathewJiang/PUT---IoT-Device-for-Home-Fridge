### Progress on temperature sensor
* The goal is the to be able to communicate with a DS18b20 sensor using Raspberry Pi.
* It requires one extra 4.7k resistor.
* Objective is to fully understand the bytes it sends and decode useing Perl instead of random Python code avalible online. 
* Sensor comes with no pins, already soldered jump wires for this in design centre.
